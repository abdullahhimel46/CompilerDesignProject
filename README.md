Sia is a lightweight, educational programming language designed to demonstrate the core phases of compiler construction using Flex, Bison, and a C-based backend. The language features a clean, Python-inspired syntax and focuses on a single advanced capability: automatic type inference, enabling the compiler to deduce variable types directly from initialization expressions. Sia supports explicit and inferred variable declarations, arithmetic and relational expressions, structured control flow (IF/ELSE and WHILE), and basic input/output operations. This project highlights the design of a minimal yet expressive programming language and demonstrates the practical integration of theoretical compiler concepts in an accessible implementation.
